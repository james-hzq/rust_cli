# rust-cli

A simple CLI tool for converting CSV to JSON.
This is a basic command-line interface (CLI) application designed to transform CSV files into JSON format. 
The tool would typically take an input CSV file, parse its contents, and generate a corresponding JSON representation that can be saved to a file or printed to standard output.
